### Overview 

When we drive, the lane lines on the road act as our constant reference for where to steer the vehicle. Naturally, one of the first things we'd like to do is to detect lane lines using an algorithm.
This project aims to automatically identify the lane lines on the road using Computer Vision techniques from camera information. Following the pipeline I developed in Â§Reflection, the effect will first tested on different individual images and later apply the result to a video stream (really just a series of images).

### Reflection

### 1. Describe the pipeline, ie. draw_lines() function.

My pipeline consists of 8 steps. 
<ol>
   <li> Read images from the directory. (matplotlib.image.imread)
   <li> Convert the images to the grayscale which returns only 1 color channel. (cv2.cvtColor)
   <li> Apply Gaussian Blur to suppress noise and spurious gradients. (gaussian_blur)
   <li> Apply Canny Edge Detections to identify boundaries in images by strength of gradients.(canny)
   <li> Create a quadrilateral masked edges image for Region of Interest. (the rest region is set to black)
   <li> Implement Hough Transformation to identify lines, containing the endpoints (x1, y1, x2, y2) of all line segments.(cv2.HoughLinesP)
   <li> Show result lines overlaying on original images (cv2.addWeighted)
   <li> Save the result in the output directory.
</ol>


#### <u> Improvement on the pipeline </u>

You will then refine your pipeline with parameter tuning and by averaging and extrapolating the lines.
At this point,I have the detected Hough lines drawn onto the road, but in line segments. So, to identify the full extent of the lane marking, I need to define a line to run the full length of the visible lane based on the line segments from the Hough Transformation. First, I take down endpoints (x1, y1, x2, y2) for every line segments and caculate the line slope ((y2-y1)/(x2-x1)) to classify which segments are part of the left line vs. the right line. Then, I average the position of each of the lines , get the average slope (k) and average intersection (b), and extrapolate to the top and bottom of the lane.
